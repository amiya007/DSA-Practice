# DSA Practice

- for Pattern 9 and 10 use pattern 7 and 8.
- for pattern 15 use the pattern 13, and replace the value with "\*" and reverse the pattern

### Pattern 13

# Basic Maths

- To get the number of digits in a integer we can use `(log10(n) + 1)` and parsed it to the integer `(int) (log10(n) + 1)`
- If we find divisors of a number with a `n` times looping the TC will be `O(n)`; by taking the `√n` times looping the TC will become `O(√n)`; again if we sort the divisors the TC will become `O(√n) + O(no. of divisors X log(no. of divisors))`

# Sorting

- ## **Selection sort**
  - hiiiiiii
- Bubble sort (Normal / Recursive)
- Insertion sort (Normal / Recursive)
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
