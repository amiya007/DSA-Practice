# Basic Setup

- Before starting the DSA with this folder structure:-

  0. You can change the `tasks.json` for the differnt devices.
  1. Change the Default shell to command prompt (cmd).
  2. After write the `.cpp` code in a file; Input will be given to the `input.txt` file and output will be shown in the `output.txt` file.
  3. Change the layout for your suitability.
  4. To run the code, Press `Ctrl + Shift + B`.

# Pattern Practice

- For Pattern 9 and 10 use pattern 7 and 8.
- For pattern 15 use the pattern 13, and replace the value with "\*" and reverse the pattern

### Pattern 13

```

# Basic Maths

- To get the number of digits in a integer we can use `(log10(n) + 1)` and parsed it to the integer `(int) (log10(n) + 1)`
- If we find divisors of a number with a `n` times looping the TC will be `O(n)`; by taking the `√n` times looping the TC will become `O(√n)`; again if we sort the divisors the TC will become `O(√n) + O(no. of divisors X log(no. of divisors))`

# Sorting

- ## **Selection sort**
  - To perform SELECTION SORT we have to follow ony 2 steps,
    1. Select minimum.
    2. Swap with the related index.
- Bubble sort (Normal / Recursive)
- Insertion sort (Normal / Recursive)
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
