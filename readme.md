# Basic Setup

- Before starting the DSA with this folder structure:-

  0. You can change the `tasks.json` for the differnt devices.
  1. Change the Default shell to command prompt (cmd).
  2. After write the `.cpp` code in a file; Input will be given to the `input.txt` file and output will be shown in the `output.txt` file.
  3. Change the layout for your suitability.
  4. To run the code, Press `Ctrl + Shift + B`.

# Pattern Practice

- For Pattern 9 and 10 use pattern 7 and 8.
- For pattern 15 use the pattern 13, and replace the value with "\*" and reverse the pattern

### Pattern 13

# Basic Maths

- To get the number of digits in a integer we can use `(log10(n) + 1)` and parsed it to the integer `(int) (log10(n) + 1)`
- If we find divisors of a number with a `n` times looping the TC will be `O(n)`; by taking the `√n` times looping the TC will become `O(√n)`; again if we sort the divisors the TC will become `O(√n) + O(no. of divisors X log(no. of divisors))`

# Sorting

- ## **Selection sort**
- Selection Method is to push the smallest element to the initial and keep itrating with the remaining elements in the array.
- To perform SELECTION SORT we have to follow ony 2 steps:-

  1. Select minimum.
  2. Swap with the related index.

- Complexity:-

  - Best Case - `O(n)`
  - Worst Case - <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>

- ## **Bubble sort (Normal / Recursive)**

- Bubble Method is to push the largeest element to the last by adjecent swaps and keep itrating adjecent elements in the array.

- To perform BUBBLE SORT we have to follow any 2 steps:-

  1. Swap the adjecent elements from the start and push the largest element to the last.
  2. Follow the same step till the array get sorted.

- Complexity:-

  - Best Case - `O(n)`
  - Worst Case - <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>

- ## **Intertion sort (Normal / Recursive)**
- It takes an element and put it to its correct position. Starting from either from the first or from last.

- Complexity:-

  - Best Case - <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>
  - Worst Case - <code>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</code>

- ## **Merge sort**
- it is a devide and solve method.
- Its is a better sorting method than above methods w.r.t Time Complexity.
- In this method we have to convert the array to nearly equal to 2 half hypothetically ( Here the time complexity is `O(log(n))` ) and arrange them in a sorted way using anothe function `( here merge() )` having the time complecity of `O(n)`

- Complexity:-

  - Best Case - `O()`
  - Worst Case -`O(n log(n))`

- Space Complexity - `O(n)`

- ## **Quick sort**
- It is slight better than merge sort in comapre to the Space Complexity.
- it is a devide and solve method.
- To perform QUICK SORT we have to follow any 2 steps:-

  1. Pick a PIVOT Point.
     - Pivot point could be at any point at starting, at end, at median or at any random index.
  2. Put the Pivot element at its sorted index.
  3. To put it on its sorted index, we have to put all the smaller elements at left side and larger elements on its right for ascending order and opposite for decending order.
  4. Perform the same operation for the pivot point of different elements.

- Complexity:-

  - Best Case - `O()`
  - Worst Case -`O(n log(n))`

- Space Complexity - `O(1)`
